I have some summary statistics of a dataset, as well as some relevant documentation about the dataset.
The dataset is called `[DATASET_NAME]`. The documentation was taken from a file called `[DOC_NAME]`.
I need to infer some attributes about each column of the dataset.

The dataset contains the following columns:
```csv
[SCHEMA]
```

The summary statistics of which are:
```json
[STATS]
```

The dataset documentation is:
```txt
[DOC]
```

Please help me infer, for each column of the dataset, the following attributes:
1. The name of the column
2. The concept that the column represents
3. The unit of the column
4. A description of the column


Please give your answer exactly in the following format:
```txt
<column name> | <concept> | <unit> | <description>
<column name> | <concept> | <unit> | <description>
...
```
Make sure to replace `<column name>`, `<concept>`, `<unit>`, and `<description>` with the correct values.
List the columns in the same order as they appear in the dataset schema, with exactly one line per column.
Also make sure to format the answer exactly as shown above, with the pipe character `|` separating the four values and a ```-block surrounding the answer.
Finally, do not merge multiple columns into one line, and do not split any one column into multiple lines.
