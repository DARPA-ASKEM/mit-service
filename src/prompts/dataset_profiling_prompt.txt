I have a dataset (given as a CSV file). The header and first few lines of the dataset are given below:
```csv
[CSV]
```

I also have the following relevant documentations for the dataset:
```txt
[DOC]
```

For each column, of the dataset, I want to infer the following attributes: its name; the concept it represents; the unit of measurement; and a brief description of the column.
Please help me infer these attributes for each column of the dataset, giving the attributes in the following format:
```
<column name> | <concept> | <unit of measurement> | <description>
```
Please make sure not to accidentally merge two columns into one, or split one column into two.
Also, please make sure that the inferred attributes are consistent with the documentation provided.
If you are not sure about the attributes of a column, please set the corresponding fields to "UNKNOWN".
