I have a paper on battery research, and I want to extraction some metadata from this paper.
I need to extract some metadata from the paper description of the model.

The metadata to be extracted is as follows:
```txt
Anode, What is the anode?
Cathode, What is the cathode?
Electrolyte, What is the electrolyte?
N/P ratio, What is the N/P ratio?
Voltage range, What is the voltage range?
Current density, What is the current density?
Beginning coulombic efficiency, What is the CE at the beginning?
End coulombic efficiency, What is CE at the end of the cycling test?
Average coulombic efficiency, What is the average CE and the scattering (standard deviation)?

```

The paper textual description is as follows:
```txt
[PAPER]
```


Please help me extract the metadata from the paper textual description of the model.
Print the result in the following format:
```txt
<field name>: <field value>
<field name>: <field value>
<field name>: <field value>
...
```
Do not hallucinate metadata; only print metadata that can be extracted from the paper description.
If the metadata cannot be extracted, please print "UNKNOWN" instead of the field value.
