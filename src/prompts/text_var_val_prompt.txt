Here is some text:

[TEXT]

This text may contain variables or parameters and what they mean.

If it does, list each of the variables on a separate line with the following attributes separated by "|":

name | description | numerical value

If there is no description for the variable, please infer a short description for that variable. If the value of the variable uses other variables or if there is no value for the variable, output "None" for that variable. Be sure to remove references enclosed in square brackets like "[" and "]" and footnotes written as superscript symbols.
