We have a list of variable names and initial values for lines of code in a Python program.The list has 17 elements
1, inv_contact_rate,1.0
2, growth_rate, 0
3, growth_rate, 2.0
4, index, 0
5, p_idx, 0
6, d_idx, 0
7, i_day, 17.0
8, n_days, 20
9, N_p, 3
10, N_t, 121
11, infections_days, 14.0
12, relative_contact_rate, 0.05
13, gamma, 1.0
14, s_n, 1000
15, i_n, 1
16, r_n, 1
17, p_idx, 0
There is also an ontology which has 4 items:
ontology = [‘population’, ‘doubling time’, ‘recovery time’, ‘infectious time’]
Some code elements have a matching element in the ontology. For example,
(s_n, 1000) matches 'population'
(relative_contact_rate, 005) matches 'number contacts'
Which element is the best match for population?
