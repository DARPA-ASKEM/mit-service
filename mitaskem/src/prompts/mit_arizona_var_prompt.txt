I have some variables extracted from a paper with ID, name, and the discription of the varible:

[MIT]

Then I have another version of the same paper with the same ID, name, and the discription of the varible:

[ARIZONA]

Can you find the best match from the second version of variable extraction for each variable in the first variable extraction?
If you can, then print the ID mapping of these variables, one on each line as follows:
within each line start with the ID from first variable extraction, then print a colon, and then follow it with the ID from the second variable extraction.
