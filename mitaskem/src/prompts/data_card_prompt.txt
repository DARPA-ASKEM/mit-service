I have a textual description of the contents of a dataset called `[DATASET_NAME]`.
The textual description was taken from a file called `[DOC_NAME]`.

I need to extract some metadata about this dataset from these inputs.
The metadata to be extracted is as follows:
```txt
[FIELDS]
```
The textual description is as follows:
```txt
[DOC]
```

Please help me extract the metadata from the dataset and the textual description.
Print the result in the following format:
```txt
<field name>: <field value>
<field name>: <field value>
<field name>: <field value>
...
```
Do not hallucinate metadata; only print metadata that can be extracted from the dataset and the textual description.
If the metadata cannot be extracted, please print "UNKNOWN" instead of the field value.
