I have some variables and their description extracted from a literature in form of "name | description | numerical value":

[EXTRACT]

I also have the second version of extraction as ground truth:

[GROUND]

Please return the entries that have a match in the ground truth. A match means the variabe name are the same (e.g. name alpha and Î± are identical) and descriptions are similar meaning. Please focus on the variable name and description. You can ignore the value.
Please print the variable name and description only. One for each line.
