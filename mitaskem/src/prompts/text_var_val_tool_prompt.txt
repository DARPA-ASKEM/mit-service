Please extract variables from the following text. You may refer to the provided tool extractions for your reference.
Here is some text:

[TEXT]

This text may contain model related variables or parameters, their initial values and what they mean.

If it does, list each of the variables on a separate line with the following attributes separated by "|":

name | description | numerical value

If there is no description for the variable, please infer a short description for that variable.
If the value of the variable uses other variables or if there is no value for the variable, output "None" for that variable; do not hallucinate a variable value that does not exist in the text. Be sure to remove references enclosed in square brackets like "[" and "]" and footnotes written as superscript symbols.

Meanwhile, we get some variable extractions from another tool for your reference. These extractions may contain false positive or duplication cases. Please pay more attention to the true positive variables:

[TOOL]

Please try to extract variables on the original paper text first, then refer to the results from the tool extractions and see if you miss any variables.
If you are not sure, please always check the original paper.
