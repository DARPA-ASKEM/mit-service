Here is some text:

[TEXT]

This text may contain model related variables or parameters, their initial values and what they mean.

If it does, list each of the variables on a separate line with the following attributes separated by "|":

name | description | numerical value

If there is no description for the variable, please infer a short description for that variable. If the value of the variable uses other variables or if there is no value for the variable, output "None" for that variable; do not hallucinate a variable value that does not exist in the text. Be sure to remove references enclosed in square brackets like "[" and "]" and footnotes written as superscript symbols.

Meanwhile, we get some variable extractions from another tool for your reference. These extractions may contrain false positive or duplication cases. Please pay more attention to the true positive variables:
