Graphical scheme representing the interactions among different stages of infection in the mathematical model SIDARTHE: S,
susceptible (uninfected); I, infected (asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic infected, undetected); D, diagnosed (asymptomatic infected, detected); A,
ailing (symptomatic infected, undetected); R, recognized (symptomatic infected, detected); T, threatened (infected with life-threatening symptoms,
detected); H, healed (recovered); E, extinct (dead).
α, β, γ and δ respectively denote the transmission rate (the probability of
disease transmission in a single contact multiplied by the average number
of contacts per person) due to contacts between a susceptible subject and an
infected, a diagnosed, an ailing or a recognized subject. Typically, α is larger
than γ (assuming that people tend to avoid contacts with subjects showing
symptoms, even though diagnosis has not been made yet), which in turn is
larger than β and δ (assuming that subjects who have been diagnosed are
properly isolated). Tese parameters can be modifed by social-distancing
policies (for example, closing schools, remote working, lockdown). Te risk
of contagion due to threatened subjects, treated in proper ICUs, is assumed
negligible.
