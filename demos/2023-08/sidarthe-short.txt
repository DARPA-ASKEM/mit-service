In Italy, 128,948 confirmed cases and 15,887 deaths of peo- ple who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were registered as of 5 April 2020. Ending the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic requires implementation of multiple population-wide strate- gies, including social distancing, testing and contact tracing. We propose a new model that predicts the course of the epi- demic to help plan an effective control strategy. The model considers eight stages of infection: susceptible (S), infected (I), diagnosed (D), ailing (A), recognized (R), threatened (T), healed (H) and extinct (E), collectively termed SIDARTHE. Our SIDARTHE model discriminates between infected indi- viduals depending on whether they have been diagnosed and on the severity of their symptoms. The distinction between diagnosed and non-diagnosed individuals is important because the former are typically isolated and hence less likely to spread the infection. This delineation also helps to explain misperceptions of the case fatality rate and of the epidemic spread. We compare simulation results with real data on the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, and we model possible scenarios of implementation of countermeasures. Our results demon- strate that restrictive social-distancing measures will need to be combined with widespread testing and contact tracing to end the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
After a novel strain of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was identi- fied in Wuhan (Hubei), China1,2, an exponentially growing num- ber of patients in mainland China were diagnosed with COVID-19, prompting Chinese authorities to introduce radical measures to con- tain the outbreak3. Despite these measures, a COVID-19 pandemic ensued in the following months. The World Health Organisation report dated 5 April 2020 reported 1,133,758 total cases and 62,784 deaths worldwide4.
Italy has been severely affected5. After the first indigenous case on 21 February 2020 in Lodi province, several suspect cases (initially epidemiologically linked) began to emerge in the south and south- west territory of Lombardy6. A ‘red zone’, encompassing 11 munici- palities where SARS-CoV-2 infection was endemic, was instituted on 22 February 2020, and put on lockdown to contain the emerging threat. A campaign to identify and screen all close contacts with confirmed cases of COVID-19 resulted in taking 691,461 nasal swabs as of 5 April 2020. Of the 128,948 detected cases, 91,246 were currently infected (28,949 hospitalized, 3,977 admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) and 58,320 quarantined at home), 21,815 had been
discharged due to recovery and 15,887 had died7. In the early days of the epidemic in Italy, both symptomatic and asymptomatic people underwent screening. A government regulation dated 26 February 2020 limited screening to symptomatic subjects only8. On 8 March 2020, to further contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the red zone was extended to the entire area of Lombardy and 14 more northern Italian provinces. On 9 March 2020, lockdown was declared for the entire country9 and progressively stricter restrictions were adopted.
COVID-19 displays peculiar epidemiological traits when com- pared with previous coronavirus outbreaks of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. According to Chinese data10, a large number of trans- missions, both in nosocomial and community settings, occurred through human-to-human contact with individuals showing no or mild symptoms. The estimated basic reproduction number (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 ranges from 2.0 to 3.511–13, which seems comparable, or possibly higher, than for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. High viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 were found in upper respiratory specimens of patients showing little or no symptoms, with a viral shedding pat- tern akin to that of influenza viruses14. Hence, inapparent transmis- sion may play a major and underestimated role in sustaining the outbreak.
Predictive mathematical models for epidemics15–18 are fun- damental to understand the course of the epidemic and to plan effective control strategies. One commonly used model is the SIR model19 for human-to-human transmission, which describes the flow of individuals through three mutually exclusive stages of infec- tion: susceptible, infected and recovered. More complex models can accurately portray the dynamic spread of specific epidemics. For the COVID-19 pandemic, several models have been developed. Lin and colleagues extended a SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infectious, removed) model considering risk perception and the cumulative number of cases20, Anastassopoulou and colleagues proposed a discrete-time SIR model including dead individuals21, Casella devel- oped a control-oriented SIR model that stresses the effects of delays and compares the outcomes of different containment policies22 and Wu and colleagues used transmission dynamics to estimate the clin- ical severity of COVID-1923. Stochastic transmission models have also been considered24,25. Here, we propose a new mean-field epide- miological model for the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy that extends the classical SIR model, similar to that developed by Gumel and col- leagues for SARS26. A summary of the main findings, limitations and implications of the model for policymakers is shown in Table 1.

mary
Curbing the global spread of SARS-CoV-2 requires implementation of multiple population-wide strategies; however, how the timing and stringency of such measures will affect ‘flattening the curve’ remains unknown. We have proposed a new model that predicts the evolution of epidemics and helps to assess the impact of different strategies to contain the spread of the infection, including lockdown and social distancing, as well as testing and contact tracing.
 Main findings and limitations
 Testing is important because undetected infected people, most of whom are asymptomatic, largely sustain the epidemic spread. Several possible scenarios have been outlined. Under the less stringent lockdown conditions with limited testing, we predict that more than 70,000 people could die in Italy in the first year. However, if strict lockdown measures continue to be maintained and population-wide testing and contact tracing efforts are substantially increased, the number of deaths could potentially be limited to 25,000 people overall. As with all modeling studies, our predictions are based on reasonable assumptions, but the actual course of the epidemic heavily relies on how and when isolation and safety measures are implemented.
 Policy implications
 Our findings confirm that the adopted social-distancing measures are necessary and effective, and should be promptly enforced at the earliest stage. Lockdown measures can only be relieved safely in the presence of widespread testing and contact tracing. Combining lockdown and population-wide testing is key to rapidly ending the COVID-19 pandemic.

 Our model, named SIDARTHE, discriminates between detected and undetected cases of infection and between different severity of illness (SOI), non-life-threatening cases (asymptomatic and pauci- symptomatic; minor and moderate infection) and potentially life- threatening cases (major and extreme) that require ICU admission.
The total population is partitioned into eight stages of dis- ease: S, susceptible (uninfected); I, infected (asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic infected, undetected); D, diagnosed (asymp- tomatic infected, detected); A, ailing (symptomatic infected, undetected); R, recognized (symptomatic infected, detected); T, threatened (infected with life-threatening symptoms, detected); H, healed (recovered); E, extinct (dead). The interactions among these stages are shown in Fig. 1. We omit the probability rate of becoming susceptible again after having recovered from the infec- tion. Although anecdotal cases are found in the literature27, the rein- fection rate value appears negligible. A detailed discussion of the model considerations and parameters is provided in the Methods.
For the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, we estimate the model parameters based on data from 20 February 2020 (day 1) to 5 April 2020 (day 46) and show how the progressive restrictions, includ- ing the most recent lockdown progressively enforced since 9 March 2020, have affected the spread of the epidemic. We also model possible longer-term scenarios illustrating the effects of different countermeasures, including social distancing and population-wide testing, to contain SARS-CoV-2.
The model parameters have been updated over time to reflect the progressive introduction of increased restrictions. On day 1, the basic reproduction number was R0 = 2.38, which resulted in a substantial outbreak. On day 4, R0 = 1.66 as a result of the introduc- tion of basic social distancing, awareness of the epidemic, hygiene and behavioral recommendations, and early measures by the Italian government (for example, closing schools). At day 12, asymptom- atic individuals were almost no longer detected, and screening was focused on symptomatic individuals (leading to R0 = 1.80). On day

The plots in b and d distinguish between the different categories of infected patients: non-diagnosed asymptomatic (ND AS), diagnosed asymptomatic (D AS), non-diagnosed symptomatic (ND S), diagnosed symptomatic (D S) and diagnosed with life-threatening symptoms (D IC).

22, a partially incomplete lockdown, of which the effectiveness was reduced by the movement of people from the north to the south of Italy when the country-wide lockdown was announced but not yet enforced, yielded R0=1.60. When the national lockdown was fully operational and strictly enforced, after day 28, R0 = 0.99, finally reaching below 1. Moreover, R0=0.85 was achieved after day 38 due to a wider testing campaign that identified more mildly symp- tomatic infected individuals. Figure 2a shows the model evolution with the estimated parameters up to day 46; in the earliest epidemic phase, the number of infected was considerably underestimated. Of the total cases, 35% were undetected. In Fig. 2b, the infected individuals are partitioned into the different subpopulations (diag- nosed or not, with different SOI classification). Over a 350-day horizon, in the absence of further policy changes, Fig. 2c predicts that 0.61% of the population will contract the virus (and 0.45% will be diagnosed), while 0.06% of the population will die from COVID- 19. The peak of the number of concurrently infected individu- als will occur on around day 50 at 0.19% of the population, while the peak of concurrently diagnosed infected individuals will occur later (around day 56) and amounts to 0.17% of the population. The actual case fatality rate (CFR) is 9.8% and the perceived CFR is 13%. Figure 2d shows that each infected subpopulation reaches its peak at a different time.
Extended Data Fig. 1 shows how the situation could have evolved if milder or stronger measures had been implemented earlier. The curve following day 22 shows the importance and effectiveness of a prompt lockdown. The actual epidemic evolution corresponds to an intermediate scenario: the lockdown measures had a moderate effect, probably due to their incremental nature.
We predict a range of possible future scenarios, with different measures enforced after day 50.
Figure 3a,b shows, if the lockdown is weakened, a sudden and strong increase of the spread of disease, a prolonged emergency and more deaths (0.12% of the population in the first 350 days). Figure 3c,d shows the benefits of stricter lockdown measures: after 350 days, 0.41% of the population would contract the virus (0.30% diagnosed) and 0.04% of the population would die.
A policy of population-wide testing and contact tracing would help to rapidly end the epidemic, as suggested by Peto28. Figure 4a,b shows the effect of such measures: the peak would be reached sooner and, after 350 days, 0.43% of the population would con- tract the virus (0.33% diagnosed), with an estimated 0.05% dying. Figure 4c,d shows the effect of combining a milder lockdown with widespread testing and contact tracing: after 350 days, 0.52% of the population would contract the virus (0.41% diagnosed) and 0.05% would die.

The plots in b and d distinguish between the different categories of infected patients: non-diagnosed asymptomatic (ND AS), diagnosed asymptomatic (D AS), non-diagnosed symptomatic (ND S), diagnosed symptomatic (D S) and diagnosed with life-threatening symptoms (D IC). Note that a,c and b,d have different scales.
Hence, the current adopted lockdown measures are vital to con- tain the epidemic and cannot be relieved. Rather, they should be even more restrictive. The enforced lockdown could be mitigated in the presence of widespread testing and contact tracing, which would strongly contribute to a rapid resolution of the epidemic. Distinguishing between diagnosed and non-diagnosed cases highlights a distortion in disease statistics. The discrepancy between the actual CFR (total number of deaths due to the infection, divided by the total number of infected people) and the perceived CFR (number of deaths ascribed to the infection, divided by the number of people diagnosed as infected) can be quantified, which explains the gap between the actual infection dynamics and perception of the outbreak. Performing an insufficient number of tests underesti- mates the transmission rate and overestimates the CFR. Our model can predict the long-term effects of underdiagnosis.
Concerning diagnostic tests for COVID-19, currently, standard molecular methods to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in respi- ratory samples are based on non-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcription methods, which target RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and E genes29. These tests are time-consuming and cannot be done on all susceptible individuals in the population; high false negatives rates have been reported and certified laboratories with expensive equipment are needed. Rapid tests with high sensitivity and specificity that can be easily adapted to real-life settings (schools, airports, train stations) are urgently
required. Some laboratories are moving in this direction, develop- ing a 15 min test to detect SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulins IgM and IgG simultaneously in human blood30.
Our model confirms that diagnosis campaigns can reduce the infection peak (the diagnosed population enters quarantine and is therefore less likely to affect the susceptible population) and help end the epidemic more quickly28. Healthcare workers are more likely to be exposed and their risk of infection is increased, as sup- ported by reports from China31,32 suggesting that disease amplifica- tion in healthcare settings will occur despite restrictive measures. The model does not consider reduced availability of medical care due to the healthcare system reaching or even surpassing its capacity33. These analyses can only be done indirectly. For example, when the number of seriously affected individuals is high (above a threshold), the mortality coefficient will be increased due to an insufficient number of ICUs.
We compare scenarios with control measures of varying strength and nature, predicting for each the timing and magnitude of the epidemic peak, including the peak of ICU admissions. According to our findings, a partial implementation of lockdown measures results in a delay in the peak of infected individuals and patients admitted to the ICU, contrasting with an only moderate decrease in the total number of infected individuals and ICU admissions. Conversely, the implementation of very strong social-distancing strategies would result in an anticipated lower peak of infected

individuals and patients admitted to the ICU, with a marked decrease in the total number of infected individuals and ICU admis- sions due to the disease.
Our findings provide policymakers with a tool to assess the consequences of possible strategies, including lockdown and social distancing, as well as testing and contact tracing. Our simulation results, achieved by combining the model with the available data about the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, suggest that enforcing strong social-distancing measures is urgent, necessary and effec- tive, in line with other reports in the literature2,22,24. The earlier the lockdown is enforced, the stronger the effect obtained. The model results also confirm the benefits of mass testing, whenever facilities are available28. We believe these indications can be useful to manage the epidemic in Italy, as well as in countries that are still in the early stages of outbreak.
Although the mortality rate (number of deaths in the whole pop- ulation) of COVID-19 can be decreased with restrictive measures that reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the CFR (number of deaths in the infected population) is essentially constant in different scenar- ios, unaffected by the extent of social restriction and testing. Despite rigid isolation policies, COVID-19 patients may still be burdened with excess case fatality, and efforts should be focused on developing more effective treatment strategies to combat COVID-19. As new drugs and vaccines are being tested and evaluated, the current sce- nario will evolve to account for these ongoing innovations34–37.

SIDARTHE mathematical model. The SIDARTHE dynamical system consists of eight ordinary differential equations, describing the evolution of the population in each stage over time:

where the uppercase Latin letters (state variables) represent the fraction of population in each stage, and all the considered parameters, denoted by Greek letters, are positive numbers. The interactions among different stages of infection are visually represented in the graphical scheme in Fig. 1. The parameters are defined as follows:
• α, β, γ and δ respectively denote the transmission rate (the probability of disease transmission in a single contact multiplied by the average number of contacts per person) due to contacts between a susceptible subject and an infected, a diagnosed, an ailing or a recognized subject. Typically, α is larger than γ (assuming that people tend to avoid contacts with subjects showing symptoms, even though diagnosis has not been made yet), which in turn is larger than β and δ (assuming that subjects who have been diagnosed are properly isolated). These parameters can be modified by social-distancing policies (for example, closing schools, remote working, lockdown). The risk of contagion due to threatened subjects, treated in proper ICUs, is assumed negligible.
• ε and θ capture the probability rate of detection, relative to asymptomatic and symptomatic cases, respectively. These parameters, also modifiable, reflect
the level of attention on the disease and the number of tests performed over the population: they can be increased by enforcing a massive contact tracing and testing campaign28. Note that θ is typically larger than ε, as a symptomatic individual is more likely to be tested.
• ζ and η denote the probability rate at which an infected subject, respectively not aware and aware of being infected, develops clinically relevant symptoms, and are comparable in the absence of specific treatment. These parameters are disease-dependent, but may be partially reduced by improved therapies and acquisition of immunity against the virus.
• μ and ν respectively denote the rate at which undetected and detected infected subjects develop life-threatening symptoms; they are comparable if there is
no known specific treatment that is effective against the disease, otherwise μ may be larger. Conversely, ν may be larger because infected individuals with more acute symptoms, who have a higher risk of worsening, are more likely to have been diagnosed. These parameters can be reduced by means of improved therapies and acquisition of immunity against the virus.
• τ denotes the mortality rate (for infected subjects with life-threatening symp- toms) and can be reduced by means of improved therapies.
• λ, κ, ξ, ρ and σ denote the rate of recovery for the five classes of infected sub- jects; they may differ significantly if an appropriate treatment for the disease is known and adopted for diagnosed patients, but are probably comparable otherwise. These parameters can be increased thanks to improved treatments and acquisition of immunity against the virus.
Discussion on modeling choices. In the model, we omit the probability rate of becoming susceptible again, after having already recovered from the infection, because this appears to be negligible based on early evidence27. Given the scarcity of available data, it is impossible to have conclusive evidence about immunity at this stage. Immunity might also be temporary38. Although some reports suggest the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection27,39,40, the indicated presence of viral RNA
in respiratory samples might reflect a persistence rather than a true recurrence. The literature on the recrudescence of related members of the coronavirus family, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, is similarly sporadic. MERS-CoV reinfection despite serum detection of neutralizing antibodies has been described
only in animals41,42, while the presence of neutralizing antibodies in serum via primary infection or passive transfer has been shown to prevent respiratory tract replication of SARS-CoV in a murine model43. From a modeling perspective, we are particularly interested in predictions over a relatively short horizon within which the temporary immunity is likely still to be in place, and the possibility of reinfection would negligibly affect the total number of susceptible individuals and so there would be no substantial difference in the evolution of the epidemic curves we consider. To provide solid support to this claim, Extended Data Fig. 2 shows the results of numerical simulation of the model when the possibility of reinfection is introduced: the evolution is almost identical, with the only difference being
that the recovered population of course decreases over time. Hence, based on the evidence at hand, although we cannot rule out that adaptive immunity against SARS-CoV-2 may not provide long-lasting protection, we may reasonably consider the probability of reinfection to be negligible within the scope of our model.
Also, our model accounts for a distinction between non-diagnosed individuals, who spread the infection more because they are not in isolation, and diagnosed individuals, who transmit the disease much less thanks to proper isolation and complying with strict rules, either in hospital or at home. Because Italy is on lockdown, extended emergency measures nationwide are being applied to contain the epidemic: unless indispensable for fundamental activities, people are forced
to stay at home in family settings, drastically reducing the risk of spreading the disease. Person-to-person household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been described in China44,45. Although the infection of household members of COVID- 19-positive individuals is possible, the rate of this occurrence is difficult to estimate so far. The only way to completely avoid such risk is to separate infected individuals in dedicated quarantine centers46, as has been done partially in Italy, confining infected people in individual hotel rooms. Even with reduced admissions to hospital, patients that are treated at home and assisted by household members strictly comply with the home isolation guidelines issued by experts47, ranging from sanitary hygiene measures (including waste management, cleaning of contaminated surfaces and household laundering) to interhuman contact measures among family members (the caregiver of a suspected or confirmed COVID- 19-infected individual in home isolation must be in good health and maintain
a distance of at least 1 m, avoiding direct contact with oral or respiratory secretions, faeces and urine; moreover, a surgical mask and disposable gloves should always be used). Hence, we can safely assume that in-house transmission is severely limited.
Although we do consider a delay in the emergence of symptoms, through asymptomatic (or pauci-symptomatic) patients, categorized as undetected (infected) and detected (diagnosed), our model does not account for a possible latency between exposure to the virus and onset of infectiousness, because there is mounting evidence that an infected individual can transmit the virus at an early, preclinical stage of the disease, based on epidemiological investigation
of COVID-19 clusters45,48–50. Moreover, recent studies estimated median serial interval values for COVID-19 to be close to or shorter than the median incubation period51,52, further proving the possibility of presymptomatic transmission of the disease. For this reason, we deemed it unnecessary to include an additional stage: although asymptomatic, individuals exposed to the virus retain a potential of viral transmission and thus reasonably fit within the infected and diagnosed stages.
Finally, the SIDARTHE model is a mean-field type of model, where the average effect of phenomena involving the whole population is captured. Social mixing patterns are incorporated into our contagion parameters in an averaged fashion over the whole population, irrespective of age. However, our model is fully flexible and suited to include, for example, a distinction between age classes, which would require splitting each variable of the model into N variables if N age classes are considered. Another possible future development is to extend the model to predict the simultaneous evolution of other diseases, which, due to the epidemic emergency, may be overestimated, underestimated or not treated appropriately because the healthcare system is overloaded, thus leading to an increased number of ‘collateral’ deaths not directly linked to the virus.
Analysis of the mathematical model. The SIDARTHE model (1)–(8) is a bilinear system with eight differential equations. The system is positive: all the state variables take non-negative values for t ≥ 0 if initialized at time 0 with non-negative values. Note that H(t) and E(t) are cumulative variables that depend only on the other ones and their own initial conditions.
The system is compartmental and demonstrates the
mass conservation property: as can be immediately checked,

Fit of the model for the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy. We infer the model parameters based on the official data (source: Protezione Civile and Ministero della Salute) about the evolution of the epidemic in Italy from 20 February 2020 (day 1) through 5 April 2020 (day 46). The official data we gathered are provided in Supplementary Table 1. We turn the data into fractions over the whole Italian population (~60 million).
The estimated parameter values are based on the data about the number
of currently infected individuals with different SOI (asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic, quarantined at home, roughly corresponding to variable D(t) in our model; symptomatic and hospitalized, roughly corresponding to variable R(t) in our model; symptomatic in life-threatening conditions, admitted to ICUs, roughly corresponding to variable T(t) in our model) and the number

 that are asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic, is that the average age of infected people is getting lower and lower, and younger patients are less likely to show serious or life-threatening symptoms.
In the possible future scenarios reported in Figs. 3 and 4, the parameters are changed after day 50 as follows. In Fig. 3a,b, α = 0.252, hence R0 = 0.98 (increased). In Fig. 3c,d, α = 0.105, hence R0 = 0.50 (significantly decreased). In Fig. 4a,b,
ε = 0.400, hence R0 = 0.59 (decreased, although not as much as in the previous scenario). In Fig. 4c,d, α = 0.420 but also ε = 0.600, therefore R0 = 0.77 (reduced, although not as much as in the previous two scenarios).
Conversely, Extended Data Fig. 1 shows the epidemic evolution that would have been predicted by the model for the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy if, after day 22, social-distancing countermeasures had been absent (Extended Data
Fig. 1a,b), mild (Extended Data Fig. 1c,d), strong (Extended Data Fig. 1e,f) and very strong (Extended Data Fig. 1g,h). In all cases, the actual CFR is ~7.2%, while the perceived CFR is ~9.0%.
Extended Data Fig. 1a,b shows that, in the absence of further countermeasures after day 22 (just closing schools and hygiene recommendations), we have
α = 0.422, γ = 0.285 and β = δ = 0.0057, hence R0 = 1.66 and the model predicts an evolution that leads to 73% of the population having contracted the virus (and ~64% having been diagnosed) and ~5.2% of the population having died because
of the contagion over a 300-day horizon (Extended Data Fig. 1a). The peak of the number of concurrently infected individuals occurs at around 76 days and amounts to ~44% of the population; however, the peak of concurrently diagnosed infected individuals occurs later, around 82 days, and amounts to 39% of the population. Extended Data Fig. 1b shows how the different subpopulations of infected individuals evolve over time, and it is interesting to notice that each subpopulation reaches its peak at a different time. In particular, the fraction of infected who need intensive care reaches its peak, almost 16.5% of the population, after 107 days.
Extended Data Fig. 1c,d shows that, with social-distancing countermeasures after day 22 having a mild effect, α = 0.285 and γ = 0.171, hence R0 = 1.13, still larger than 1. Hence, the peak is delayed (and reduced in amplitude), because the increase in the number of new infected is reduced. Over a 500-day horizon, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 1c, the model predicts an evolution that leads to a peak in
the number of concurrently infected individuals around day 170, amounting
to 11.7% of the population (10.6% of the population have been diagnosed). Eventually, 35% of the population have contracted the virus (and ~30% have been diagnosed) and ~2.5% of the population have died because of the contagion. The fraction of patients in need of intensive care, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 1d, reaches its peak on day 198, amounting to 5.3% of the population. The adopted social-distancing policy, although mild, has some impact and helps gain more time to strengthen and supply the healthcare system, but is still insufficient.
Extended Data Fig. 1e,f shows that, with stronger social-distancing countermeasures, able to yield α = 0.200 and γ = 0.086, hence R0 = 0.787, now lower than 1, the peak is not delayed, but anticipated, because the increase in the number of new infected is reduced so much that it soon becomes a decrease. Over a 300-day horizon, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 1e, the model predicts an evolution of the situation that leads to a peak in the number of concurrently infected individuals around day 50, amounting to 0.092% of the population; the peak in diagnosed infected occurs at day 54 and amounts to 0.083% of the population. Eventually, 0.25% of the population have contracted the virus (and ~0.22% have been diagnosed) and ~0.02% of the population have died because of the contagion. The fraction of patients in need of intensive care, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 1f, reaches its peak on day 85, amounting to 0.04% of the population.
Extended Data Fig. 1g,h shows that, with even stronger social-distancing countermeasures, α = γ = 0.057, hence R0 = 0.0329, significantly lower than 1. Over
a 300-day horizon, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 1g, the model predicts an evolution of the situation that leads to a peak in the number of concurrently infected individuals around day 25, amounting to 0.057% of the population; the peak in diagnosed infected occurs at day 35 and amounts to 0.048% of the population. Eventually, 0.086% of the population have contracted the virus (and ~0.074% have been diagnosed) and ~0.006% of the population have died because of the contagion. The fraction of patients in need of intensive care, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 1h, reaches its peak on day 64, amounting to 0.02% of the population.
These scenarios, although surpassed, are fundamental to prove that lockdown was an appropriate policy, given that, in the absence of social-distancing countermeasures, the epidemic could have had tragic outcomes; also, they suggest—for countries early on in the outbreak evolution—that strictly enforcing the lockdown as early as possible leads to enormous benefits with respect to a delayed intervention.
Model sensitivity analysis. We now investigate the sensitivity of the model
to parameter variations, focusing in particular on the parameters that can be influenced by policymakers: transmission parameters, related to lockdown measures (α, β, γ and δ), and testing parameters, related to testing and contact tracing policies (ε, θ). To illustrate the effect of changing the parameter values in the model, our sensitivity analysis results are reported in Extended Data Figs. 4–10.
Interestingly, the model is particularly sensitive to variations in the value of α and of ε. Increasing α significantly increases all the curves (Extended Data Fig. 4). Also increasing the other transmission parameters, β, γ and δ, increases all the
curves—that is, increases the values of all the variables, point by point, over time (Extended Data Figs. 5–7), although the sensitivity is smaller. All these parameters can be decreased by policymakers, by enforcing lockdown and social-distancing measures, and stringent safety procedures in hospitals and for home assistance of diagnosed infected.
Conversely, increasing ε significantly decreases all the curves (Extended Data Fig. 8). Also increasing the other testing parameter θ decreases all the curves—that is, decreases the values of all the variables, point by point, over time (Extended Data Fig. 9), but the sensitivity is smaller. These two parameters can be increased by policymakers by enforcing population-wide testing and contact tracing, focused on discovering, respectively, asymptomatic and symptomatic infections. Discovering infected people at an earlier stage appears to help reduce the contagion more.
The other parameters are harder to control with prevention and mitigation strategies (Extended Data Fig. 10). Increasing ζ and η decreases the final number of infected and recovered, but also increases the number of deaths; the number
of symptomatic and life-threatening infections initially increases, to decrease afterwards. Increasing μ and ν decreases the final number of infected and recovered, but also increases the number of deaths; the number of life-threatening infections initially increases, to decrease afterwards. Increasing λ, as well as the other healing parameters ρ, κ, ξ and σ, decreases all the curves, apart from the curve of recovered patients, which initially increases (due to a higher recovery rate) and then eventually decreases (due to fewer infections overall). Increasing τ leaves all the curves almost unaffected, apart from the curve of life-threatened infected, which is decreased, also leading to a small decrease in the curve of all infected cases, a decrease in the curve of recovered and an increase in the curve of deaths.
Discussion of the model features. The key feature of our proposed model is
the distinction between detected and undetected infection cases, and between cases with different SOI classifications (mild and moderate versus major and extreme). Distinguishing between diagnosed and not diagnosed cases allows us
to highlight the perceived distortion in disease statistics, such as the number of infected individuals, the transmission rate and the CFR (the ratio between the number of deaths ascribed to the infection and the number of diagnosed cases). The discrepancy between the actual CFR (total number of deaths due to the infection, divided by the total number of people who have been infected) and the perceived CFR (number of deaths ascribed to the infection, divided by the number of people who have been diagnosed as infected) can be quantified based on this model. Therefore, the model can explain the possible discrepancy between the actual infection dynamics and the perception of the phenomenon. Misperception (either resulting in underestimating or overestimating) can be particularly relevant in the early phases of an epidemic phenomenon due to the lack of thorough information: for example, performing an insufficient number of tests may lead
to underestimating the transmission rate (because many infected subjects are not diagnosed as such) and overestimating the CFR (because critical or fatal cases hardly go undetected). The model thus provides a rough quantification of the error in estimating the actual number of infected people due to the lack of proper diagnostic tests, or due to insufficient number of diagnostic tests being performed. Also, it can explain and predict the long-term effects of underdiagnosis, including the (apparently surprising) increased number of infections and fatalities, with sudden outbreaks after long silent periods.
Once the model parameters have been estimated on the basis of the available clinical data, the model enables us to reproduce and predict the dynamic evolution of the epidemic and to evaluate the possible underestimation or overestimation of the epidemic phenomenon based on current statistics, which are heavily subject
to bias (for example, asymptomatic patients may get tested according to some protocols, not tested according to others).
The model helps evaluate and predict the effect of the implementation of different guidelines and protocols (for example, more extensive screening for the disease or stricter social-distancing measures), which typically results in a change in the model parameters.
The model predictions in the long run are not very sensitive to the initial conditions, but they are sensitive to the parameter values (and in particular extremely sensitive to some of these, as our sensitivity analysis has indicated), which are deeply uncertain and can vary due to several factors, such as population density, cultural habits, environmental conditions and age distribution of the population. The predictions must also consider parameter variations due to the measures imposed by the government. This is a fundamental aspect: in the long term, not imposing drastic measures leads to catastrophic outcomes, even when the initially affected population is a small fraction.
Social-distancing measures are modeled by reducing the infection coefficients α, β, γ and δ. The infection peak time is not monotonic with increasing restrictions. Partial restrictions on population movements postpone the peak, while strong restrictions anticipate the peak. Mild containment measures may have negative effects, for example augmenting the fraction of the population with life-threatening symptoms with respect to the fraction of population with mild symptoms.
Diagnosis campaigns can reduce the infection peak, because the diagnosed population enters quarantine and hence is less likely to affect the susceptible population.
