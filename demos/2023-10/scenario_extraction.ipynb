Sensitivity analysis showing the effect of varying, after day 50: the worsening coefficients ζ and η leading to clinically relevant symptoms, whose nominal values are ζ = η = 0.0250 (row a); the worsening coefficients μ and ν leading to life-threatening symptoms, whose nominal values are μ = 0.0080 and ν = 0.0150 (row b); the healing coefficient λ, whose nominal value is λ = 0.0800 (row c); the healing coefficients ρ, κ, ξ and σ, whose nominal values are ρ = κ = ξ = 0.0200 and σ = 0.0100 (row d); the mortality coefficient τ, whose nominal value is τ = 0.0100 (row e). In all cases, the nominal value of all the considered parameters is multiplied by 0.5, 0.8, 1, 1.2, 2, and the corresponding evolution of the model variables is shown. Increasing ζ and η decreases the final number of infected and recovered, but also increases the number of deaths; the number of symptomatic and life-threatening infections initially increases, to decrease afterwards. Increasing μ and ν decreases the final number of infected and recovered, but also increases the number of deaths; the number of life-threatening infections initially increases, to decrease afterwards. Increasing λ, as well as the other healing parameters, decreases all the curves, apart from the curve of recovered patients, which initially increases (due to a higher recovery rate) and then eventually decreases (due to less infections overall). Increasing τ leaves all the curves almost unaffected, apart from the curve of life-threatened infected that is decreased, leading to a small decrease in the curve of all infected cases, the curve of recovered that is decreased and the curve of deaths that is increased.</textarea></td>\n",
